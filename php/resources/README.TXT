PHP Generic Registration Module (PHP-GEREMO)
============================================

PHP Generic Registration Module (HTML snippets, e-mail templates and text
labels/messages).

Should you need to modify those resources, please copy its content to some
other directory and update the 'resources_dir' configuration parameter
accordingly (see the sample 'config.php' for further information).
